I'm an award-winning technology journalist with a 30-year career, writing for ZDNet News, CNET, SecurityFocus, MIT 
Technology Review, and Dark Reading, among many others. I graduated with a dual degree in electrical engineering and 
computer science. I did research in Japan focusing on early machine-learning research before moving into technology 
journalism to tackle more society-focused problems. I've received five awards for journalism, including the Society of 
Professional Journalist's Sigma Delta Chi award for Best Deadline Journalism (Online) in 2003 for coverage of the 
Blaster worm. 

Currently, I write for Dark Reading and MIT Technology Review's Insights, as well as conduct data analysis and write 
threat reports for a number of clients using the Python data-analysis stack (Pandas/Polars, Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly). 
Recent reports include analyses of the shortage in cybersecurity workers and annual vulnerability trends. I'm always 
looking for interesting data to analyze and understand trends in technology and how it affects people. I also write 
technically deep, yet engaging, white papers and reports for a select group of corporate clients.
