More than three-quarters of CISOs across the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa are planning to [boost their cybersecurity 
budgets](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/middle-east-africa-cisos-plan-to-increase-2024-budgets-by-ten-percent) by at least 10% in 2024, driving total regional investment past $6.5 billion. Driving this growth are
escalating cybercrimes — including state-sponsored threats and destructive 'wiper' malware — tighter 
data regulations, and rising uncertainty around generative AI — especially in core markets like 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which are leading the regional surge.
