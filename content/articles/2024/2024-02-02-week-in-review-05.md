Lots of global coverage this week. Security researchers exposed Iran's use of cyber centers to hide the activity of their advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, while US officials warned that China's state-sponsored actors were 'pre-positioning' to attack US critical infrastructure, as an adjunct to a physical conflict, such as an invasion of Taiwan.
