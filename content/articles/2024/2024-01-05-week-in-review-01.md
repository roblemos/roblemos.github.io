Happy New Year! I took off running this year with four articles published to _Dark Reading_, including two forward looking articles I wrote last year: First, covering the privacy landscape facing companies, and second, technical advice on how to get up and running with passkeys, which are more convenient and increase security. Finally, I covered two threats reported this week, including the Apache ERP vulnerability and the sale of a remote access trojan (RAT) in the Middle East.
