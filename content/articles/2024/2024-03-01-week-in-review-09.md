The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has [revised the book](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/nist-cybersecurity-framework-2-0-4-steps-get-started) on creating a comprehensive 
cybersecurity program that aims to help organizations of every size be more secure. Here's where to start 
putting the changes into action.

Convincing phishing emails, synthetic identities, and deepfakes all have been [spotted in cyberattacks on the 
continent](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/ai-powered-threats-cyberattacks-on-infrastructure-pummel-africa). 
Applications are increasingly distributed, expanding companies' cloud attack surfaces and [requiring regular testing to 
find and fix vulnerabilities](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/pentesting-as-a-service-cloud-applications)
— and avoid the risk of a growing sprawl of services.

The White House Office of the National Cyber Director [puts software developers on notice](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/us-government-taking-bigger-role-in-software-security), calling for a move to 
memory-safe programming languages and the development of security metrics. UNC1549, aka Smoke Sandstorm and Tortoiseshell, 
appears to be the culprit [behind a cyberattack campaign customized for each targeted organization]https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/illusive-iranian-hacking-group-ensnares-israeli-uae-aerospace-and-defense-firms.
