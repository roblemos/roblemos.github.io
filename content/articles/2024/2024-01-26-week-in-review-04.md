I wrote three articles this week, including efforts by the the US federal government to help critical infrastructure firms to defend against increasing cyberattacks on water suppliers and wastewater utilities. Also, researchers are delving into the security risks associated with the rapid adoption of large language models, indicating that many companies may not have fully assessed the security implications for their operations. Finally, skimming attacks on e-commerce sites — frequently referred to as Magecart attacks — are now targeting Middle Eastern retailers with credit-card skimming operations.
