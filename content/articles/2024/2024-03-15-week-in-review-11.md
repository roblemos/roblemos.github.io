The NSA's zero-trust guidelines and the exposure of over 150,000 vulnerable devices in the UAE highlight 
the growing need for enhanced cybersecurity across industries, especially as misconfigurations and insecure 
services leave critical infrastructures at risk. Meanwhile, the rise of software-defined cars and the rapid 
adoption of AI models introduce new attack surfaces, further emphasizing the need for visibility and robust 
security measures in both traditional and emerging technologies.
