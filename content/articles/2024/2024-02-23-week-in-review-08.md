The SEC’s new breach-disclosure rules empower regulators to impose steep civil penalties—potentially ranging from 
hundreds of thousands up to millions of dollars—for publicly traded companies that fail to report “material” 
cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner. Enforcement tools include injunctions, disgorgement, officer/director bans, 
and escalating per-violation fines of $5K–$500K, plus costly legal battles, reputational harm, and shareholder suits.

Google researchers found that their Gemini large language model can automatically generate functional patches for about 
15% of vulnerabilities detected by runtime sanitizer tools, addressing issues like uninitialized memory, race conditions, 
and buffer overflows. The AI system also integrates automated testing, discarding faulty patches that break builds or 
fail to fix the bug—essential for scaling remediation across thousands of findings. As codebases grow and AI-generated 
code becomes more widespread, such [automated patching tools promise to reduce backlog](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/ai-patch-ease-developer-operations-workload), 
boost developer productivity, and strengthen application security.
