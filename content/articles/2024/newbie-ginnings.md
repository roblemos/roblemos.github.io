In February, I saw a call for proposals to submit a story — of up to 5 pages — for comic anthology being produced 
by Green Archer Comics, a small outfit whose founders have some cybersecurity roots. I asked if they were still 
interested in submissions. (They were.) So I asked my daughter — a double major in computer science and media arts — 
if she would be interested in doing the comic. (She was.)

So, after a weekend of brainstorming, I came up with a story and passed it along to her. My few hours of work ended up
being dozens of hours of drawing for her. I think the effort came out great. Both of us had never done a comic before, 
so it was a phenomenal experience.

The anthology is [*Newbie-ginnings: A Cybersecurity Comic Anthology* from Green Archer Comics](https://www.greenarcher.io/newbie-ginnings).
