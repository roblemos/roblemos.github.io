Despite rising compensation and expanded responsibilities, CISOs [face challenges due to tight security budgets](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/ciso-stature-rises-budgets-tight). A survey 
by IANS Research indicates that CISOs at large U.S. companies earn an average of $532,000, reflecting their growing 
role in assessing business risk and digital strategy. However, budget approvals are more likely when expenditures are 
directly linked to business growth initiatives, highlighting the need for CISOs to align security efforts with 
organizational objectives.

Indian police in the state of Andhra Pradesh [dismantled a cybercrime operation modeled after Southeast Asian scam centers](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/indian-police-arrest-cybercrime-gang-copycats-myanmar-biz-model), 
arresting 33 individuals and detaining over 100. Operating from the Atchutapuram Special Economic Zone, the group ran 
fake call centers impersonating Amazon support to defraud victims in the US, UK, and Australia. Experts attribute 
the proliferation of such syndicates in regions like India to factors such as a large pool of tech workers, 
economic disparities, and weak cybercrime law enforcement.
