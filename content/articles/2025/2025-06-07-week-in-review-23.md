Microsoft and CrowdStrike have 
[launched a joint initiative](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/microsoft-crowdstrike-rosetta-stone-apt)
to harmonize the naming of cyber threat groups, aiming to 
reduce confusion caused by differing labels across security vendors. By publishing a mapping of over 80 threat actor 
aliases, such as aligning Microsoft's "Canary Typhoon" with CrowdStrike's "Circuit Panda," they seek to streamline 
threat intelligence and improve response times. However, this effort faces skepticism, as similar attempts have been 
made before, and questions remain about its effectiveness in addressing emerging threats and achieving broader 
industry adoption.

With a rise in cyberattacks — up 23% in 2023 — and a severe shortage of cybersecurity professionals, international 
organizations are collaborating with nations throughout the continent on initiatives like the UNDP's Tech4Peace and 
Carnegie Mellon University's picoCTF-Africa. The collaborative efforts are [training thousands of students across 
the continent](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/cybersecurity-training-africa-professionals-ranks) 
in cybersecurity skills. These programs aim not only to bolster digital defenses but also to provide economic 
opportunities and deter youth from joining armed groups.
