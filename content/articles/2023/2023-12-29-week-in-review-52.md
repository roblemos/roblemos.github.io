I'm taking the week off, but a couple of my articles written last week ended up publishing during the break. The chasm between what businesses are willing to pay cybersecurity-skilled workers (and their expectations of what skills a worker has) continues to crash into what workers think they are worth. The result is cybersecurity executives wanting more professionals, but not being able to pay the required amount. Continuing to ramp up my coverage of the Middle East and Africa region for Dark Reading, I covered the efforts among African nations to convert their young populations into highly skilled workers, including in cybersecurity.
