by Green Archer Comics, a small outfit whose founders have some cybersecurity roots. I asked if they were still 
interested in submissions. (They were.) So I asked my daughter — a double major in computer science and media arts — 
if she would be interested in doing the comic. (She was.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after a weekend of brainstorming, I came up with a story and passed it along to her. My few hours of work ended up
being dozens of hours of drawing for her. I think the effort came out great. Both of us had never done a comic before, 
so it was a phenomenal experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anthology is &lt;a href="https://www.greenarcher.io/newbie-ginnings"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newbie-ginnings: A Cybersecurity Comic Anthology&lt;/em&gt; from Green Archer Comics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="My Works"></category><category term="cybersecurity"></category><category term="comics"></category></entry></feed>
